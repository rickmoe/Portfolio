          <h4>Why Hire Me?</h4>
          <p>
            I have been passionately programming for 7 years in a variety of
            languages and environments. I have a proven work ethic, as shown
            through my academic success. I am a strong communicator and a team
            player at heart. I have experience working on and leading a software
            development team of an FRC robotics team.
